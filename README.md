# 🧱 Simple Proof-of-Work Blockchain in Python

A minimal blockchain implementation in Python, demonstrating the core concepts of:
- Transactions
- Blocks
- Proof-of-Work mining
- Chain validation
- Mining rewards

This project is for **educational purposes** and helps understand how a simple blockchain works.

---

## 📘 Overview

This blockchain includes:
- `Transaction` class — represents a transfer between two addresses  
- `Block` class — contains transactions, timestamp, nonce, and hash logic  
- `Blockchain` class — manages the chain, mining, and pending transactions  

Mining uses a basic **proof-of-work (PoW)** mechanism where the block hash must start with a number of zeros defined by the difficulty level.

## 🧩 Example Usage

```bash
python blockchain1.py
